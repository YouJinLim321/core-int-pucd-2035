      <p> Late night Your eyes fell to the floor
      I’m trying to make sense
      But you’re losing your patience
      Hands talk, won’t stop
      We go to war
      In the heat of the moment
      You think that we’re broken
      I could see my whole life with you baby
      Now you got me thinking that I’m crazy
      ‘Cause you’re
      Out the door
      Just one mistake
      You say you’re not in love no more
      But was it really love if you can leave me for
      Something so innocent
      Is this the end?
      Thought you’d be there through thick and thin</p>

<p>Can’t sleep, can’t eat
   My mind’s a mess
   What are you thinking?
   You were happy last weekend
   All the good times
   How’d you forget
   I was your best friend, yeah
   Remember when you said</p>

<P class="pull quote">You could see your whole life with me baby
Now you got me thinking that I’m crazy</P>
<p>‘Cause you’re 
Out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Now you're out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything</p>
